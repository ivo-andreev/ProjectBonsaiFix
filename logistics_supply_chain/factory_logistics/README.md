## Resources Deployed

- Bonsai (and child RG and resources)
- Virtual Machine
- Network Interface
- Network Security Group
- Virtual Network
- Public IP Address

# How it works

Takes a template approach to deploying the resources:

**CreateSolutionAccelerator** sets up the input parameters<br>
1. *CreateBonsaiArm* creates the Bonsai resources 
2. *CreateWindowsVirtualMachineWithExtension* creates the virtual machine and required networking components to RDP to the machine. <br> - Runs the `powershell_extension.ps1` script which sets an envrionment variable from (2), downloads Python, installs the bonsai CLI, and downloads AnyLogic and the `startup.bat` script, which is used by the VM when the user launches logs in.

# VM Launch

When the user logs in, they see the typical Windows startup (ie, permissions for data capture, network connection). The `startup.bat` file runs. It 

- clones the https://github.com/microsoft/bonsai-anylogic repository
- installs bonsai-cli
- runs bonsai configure [workspace-id] (workspace ID is an environment variable)
- creates a brain
- uploads the inkling
- starts an Edge session for docs
- launches AnyLogic
